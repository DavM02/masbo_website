    title: "Sketch of Style and Mood",
    text: "We start by creating an initial sketch that captures the style, mood, and atmosphere of the space. Each sketch is customized to the client’s vision and project goals. We explore color palettes, spatial arrangements, and material concepts. This stage allows us to test ideas visually and make early adjustments. By the end, the client receives a clear sense of the direction for the project. It forms the foundation for the entire design process."

  {
    title: "3D Visualization",
    text: "Our 3D visualizations transform concepts into realistic digital models. Clients can experience lighting, textures, and layouts in a virtual space. This process helps identify potential issues before construction begins. It also allows for precise material and color selection. By visualizing every detail, the client can make informed decisions confidently. The result is a clear picture of the final space before any physical work starts."
  },
  {
    title: "Specification for Components",
    text: "We provide comprehensive specifications for all elements, including furniture, finishes, and fixtures. Each selection is carefully chosen to match the overall design intent. This ensures consistency and quality throughout the project. Detailed specifications help avoid misunderstandings during construction. Clients receive a complete reference guide for every component. This stage guarantees that the finished space matches the envisioned concept precisely."

  {
    title: "Author's Supervision",
    text: "Our team oversees the project from start to finish, maintaining the integrity of the design. We coordinate with contractors, suppliers, and engineers to ensure quality. Regular site visits help us address issues proactively. This supervision guarantees that every detail is executed according to plan. Clients benefit from our expertise, reducing the risk of errors. The final result reflects the original vision accurately and efficiently."

    title: "Interior Concept",
    text: "We develop a comprehensive interior concept tailored to the client’s lifestyle and needs. It includes layout planning, material choices, color schemes, and lighting solutions. Every element is considered to create a harmonious and functional space. We also focus on how the space feels and flows for those who use it. The concept serves as a roadmap for the detailed design phase. It ensures consistency and clarity in every subsequent decision."

  {
    title: "Design Project",
    text: "The design project translates the concept into actionable plans and drawings. It includes detailed floor plans, elevations, and technical documentation. Every aspect is carefully thought through to ensure feasibility and quality. This stage allows the team to anticipate challenges and find solutions early. Clients receive a complete guide for construction and implementation. It guarantees that the final space will reflect the initial vision with precision."
  },
  {
    title: "Working Documentation",
    text: "We prepare exhaustive working documentation for contractors and builders. It contains exact measurements, installation instructions, and technical details. This ensures construction proceeds smoothly and accurately. Clear documentation helps avoid mistakes and misunderstandings. It serves as a reference throughout the project, from start to finish. The result is a fully realized space built exactly as designed."
